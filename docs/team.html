          <p>Dr Buchanan received his PhD in Molecular Genetics in 2010 from The University of Queensland’s School of Medicine.</p><p>In 2014, he moved his laboratory to the Department of Pathology at The University of Melbourne after 10 years at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute. His research focuses on the genetic classification, aetiology and architecture of colorectal cancer. His current research projects focus on 1) identifying novel genetic risk factors for colorectal cancer using next generation sequencing, 2) identifying biologically and clinically relevant subtypes of colorectal neoplasia through tumour profiling and integration of genetic, epigenetic, somatic mutations and histopathological features, and 3) Strategies to identify colorectal cancer-affected individuals within the population who carry mutations in established high-risk genes for Lynch syndrome and polyposis syndromes.</p><p>He has over 100 peer-reviewed publications on various aspects of hereditary cancer syndromes including diagnostic and translational applications.  As a result of his publications on tumour and germline testing to identify mismatch repair gene mutations (including the utility of testing adenomas, breast and prostate cancers), he was invited to join the scientific advisory board of the Lynch Syndrome Australia organization.</p><p>Dr Buchanan is the Co-Principal investigator of the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry, a member of the steering committee for the International Colon Cancer Family Registry Cohort (C-CFR) and the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) for colorectal cancer.  He is the Chair of both the "Gene discovery and Post-GWAS" and "Molecular Pathology" working groups of the C-CFR. Since 2006, he has led the molecular genetic testing and the biorepository activities for the Australasian site of the International Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon-CFR), a $23m National Institution of Health (NIH) project that has been funded for four consecutive five-year periods (1997–2017) to become Australia’s largest repository of colorectal cancer family data. During this time he has successfully led several large scale molecular testing projects for the Colon-CFR and MCCS including whole-exome and whole genome sequencing of &gt;200 colorectal cancer-affected and polyp-affected individuals, SNP genotyping for &gt;10,000 participants, DNA methylation for &gt;3000 CRCs and somatic mutation testing for &gt;10,000 colorectal cancers and polyps. Dr Buchanan is also a key member of the research team on a NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence to identify inherited genetic risk factors for colorectal cancer. He is responsible for the bioresources of the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR). Since 2006, he has supervised over 20 researchers, post-doctoral fellows and technicians with wide-ranging skill sets required for internationally competitive research for this and other studies.</p>

          <p>My career has combined clinical practice, biomedical research and translation of research into practice and policy.  I am a clinician scientist in Clinical Genetics, Cancer Genetics and Dermatology.  In 2006, I was appointed as Inaugural Chair of Adult Clinical Genetics at the University of Melbourne and the Royal Melbourne Hospital. At this time, I was also appointed Melbourne Health's Executive Director of Research; during my 12-year tenure I was able to enhance the embedding of research into clinical practice in this large academic teaching hospital.</p><p>While I work across many domains within clinical genetics, my research interests have focused on colorectal cancer (CRC), especially the potential for CRC prevention. I have used knowledge generated by our and other’s research to optimise state of the art clinical genetic services in adult medicine, with a focus on familial cancer.  I have worked for &gt; 20 years through the international Colon Family Registry.  I am the PI of the NHMRC-funded study on Sebaceous skin lesions and Muir-Torre syndrome.</p><p> As a practicing clinician, I provide academic and clinical leadership in the inherited cancer clinics for &gt; 30 years.  I serve/ have served on multiple high-level committees within Australia, and Victoria, which places me well to translate research findings into practice and policy.  These have included the Victorian Cancer Agency, where I previously chaired a working group on cancer prevention.  I served on the Victorian Cancer Action Plan Implementation Committee. I developed the original Special Interest Group for Cancer Genetics for the Human Genetic Society of Australasia, having previously chaired their Committee for Cancer Genetics.  I have been on the Steering Committees and currently on Clinical Research Advisory Committee of the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre.  As past chair and initiator of the Victorian Hospital Research Directors Forum, I have been a frequent spokesperson for clinical and translational research.  I served on the Steering Committee for the Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance (2013 to 2019).  I am a Director of the Boards of the Australian Genome Research Facility and Global Variome.  I am Chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a member of the NHMRC Council and until recently, was a member of the Health Research Strategy External Advisory Group for New Zealand.  I continue to serve on Boards, following 10 years as a Director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, and a member of the inaugural Peter Doherty Institute Council.</p><p>I have been successful in attracting research collaborations. My funding record ($75,341,058 as an Investigator) and publication list (&gt; 230) demonstrate the pivotal role I play in clinical and translational research.  I continue to lead the innovation agenda within the hospital sector.  I am principle investigator of the Victorian Health Accelerator Network (VHNx), a novel system of hospital-based accelerators within an innovation ecosystem.</p><p>In 2020, I was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for 'distinguished service to medicine, particularly to clinical genetics and research, to cancer prevention, and as a role model and mentor.'</p>

He obtained his Ph.D. through the University of Bristol, whilst studying the genomic architecture of the chicken Natural Killer Complex and its relation to Marek’s disease resistance.</p><p>Upon the completion of his Ph.D. he took up a postdoctoral position at the Ohio State University under the mentorship of the world-renowned human geneticist Albert de la Chapelle. Here, Mark utilised the molecular techniques and knowledge acquired from working with the chicken genome to advance our understanding of the mutational spectrum involved in Lynch syndrome, a genetic disease which predisposes affected individuals to a spectrum of cancers, primarily colorectal (bowel) and endometrial (uterus).</p><p>In 2008, Mark joined the familial cancer laboratory at QIMR in Brisbane where he was able to apply his molecular knowledge to the Australian colon cancer family cohort. Currently, Mark continues to work on Lynch syndrome as well as other subtypes of familial colorectal cancer, within the Oncogenomics Group at the University of Melbourne.</p><p>In particular, Mark’s work has focused on the PMS2 gene and through the development of a novel mutation screening method he has achieved worldwide recognition as an authority on the validity and interpretation of mutations within this gene.</p>

          <p>After completing a national-award winning PhD in computer science in 2007, and then a research internship at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, Bernard returned to the University of Melbourne to take up a lecturing position in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering. In 2010 he joined the newly-formed VLSCI (now Melbourne Bioinformatics), a $100M project to build a world-leading centre for bioinformatics and computational biology. In making the transition from computer science to bioinformatics, Bernard recognised the exciting new opportunities provided by the genomics revolution in biomedicine, and was inspired to apply his computing and analytic skills to important problems in human health.</p><p>During his years at Melbourne Bioinformatics, Bernard has established himself as an expert in the development of novel techniques for the analysis of large-scale genomics data sets, resulting in the production of tools which have driven key discoveries in human disease, and which can be re-applied in many different contexts. As Lead Bioinformatician for Human Genomics, Bernard heads several high profile, multidisciplinary research projects, with national and international partners.</p><p>In 2017 Bernard was awarded a Victorian Health and Medical Research Fellowship, funded by the Victorian Government, supporting his work on the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Australia has one of the highest rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the world. Survival from CRC and patient quality of life are significantly improved by early detection, treatment, and risk management. Therefore, identifying those individuals within the population who are at the highest risk of developing CRC offers the greatest potential for its prevention. Bernard and his collaborators aim to develop new diagnostic tools that will personalise risk assessment for a large group of high-risk individuals, leading to better-targeted screening and medical intervention, aimed at those who will benefit most.</p>
