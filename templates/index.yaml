name: Colorectal Oncogenomics Group 
tagline: Discovering the causes of colorectal cancer, reducing its incidence, and improving patient outcomes.
overview: |
   <p>Our research includes the identification and investigation of clinically and biologically relevant subtypes of colorectal cancer (CRC), including both familial and non-familial CRC, that can be identified through genetic, epigenetic, somatic and histopathological characterisation of CRC tumours and their pre-malignant lesions (polyps).</p>

research:
  - Identifying novel genetic risk factors for CRC. 
  - Improving our understanding of major CRC-related diseases, such as <span data-toggle="popover" title="Lynch Syndrome" data-content="Individuals who carry a high-risk mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes, increasing their risk of developing certain cancers, including CRC."><mark>Lynch Syndrome</mark></span> and <span data-toggle="popover" title="Serrated Polyposis Syndrome" data-content="Individuals who have multiple serrated polyps in their colon, which increases their risk of developing CRC."><mark>Serrated Polyposis Syndrome</mark></span> 
  - Identifying biomarkers of risk and poor prognosis in CRC.
