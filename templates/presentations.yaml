  abstract: "Only a small proportion of the heritable risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) can currently be attributed to mutations within known CRC-associated genes. To address this problem we have undertaken a large-scale study of individuals (N=1130) with a family history of CRC or early onset CRC, using whole genome, exome and targeted DNA sequencing, yielding new likely pathogenic variants in FAN1, NTHL1, POLE and POLD1. In such large studies, variant prioritization for further validation is critical to efficiently direct precious research resources. In this work we will demonstrate our bioinformatics analysis workflow for shortlisting variants for further study in the context of predicted CRC variants, which is likely to be applicable to other rare, highly penetrant, inherited diseases. In the process of refining our workflow we explored the veracity of functional impact prediction tools in order to optimize for sensitivity and specificity of classification. This has led to new insights into the limited degree of concordance and generalizability of classifiers and their dependence on training datasets. We will also describe our efforts to derive new assay-driven test data sets which may be valuable for future benchmarking experiments, and provide more robust assessments of predictor accuracy."
